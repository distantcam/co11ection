Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions. These Terms are derived from the terms published by Wordpress.com under CC BY-SA 4.0 and are also available under a Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Sharealike license</a>. You’re more than welcome to copy them, adapt them, and repurpose them for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your Terms reflect your actual practices. Also, if you do use these Terms, we’d appreciate a credit and link to Collected Notes somewhere on your website.</p><h4>Terms of Service</h4><p>These Terms govern your access to and use of Collected Notes, collectednotes.com website and mobile apps as well as all content and Collected Notes products and services available at or through these websites or mobile apps (collectively, “Services”). For some of Collected Notes’s other products and services additional Terms of Service may apply and will be posted on the websites for those products and services. Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance, without modification, of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, &quot;Collected Notes’s Privacy Policy&quot;), and procedures that may be published from time to time by Collected Notes (collectively, the “Agreement”). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and the Agreement will apply to any upgrades. Please read the Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms of the Agreement, then you may not access or use our Services.</p><h4>1. Who’s Who</h4><p>Throughout these Terms, “you” applies to both individuals and entities that access or use our Services. If you are an individual using our Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to the Agreement and that by using our Service(s), you are accepting the Agreement on behalf of that entity. Your Agreement is with Collected Notes Corp. We refer to Collected Notes Corp. as “Collected Notes” or “we” throughout these Terms.</p><h4>2. Your Account</h4><p>Where use of our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account and keep the information current. This is important because sometimes we may need to send you notable updates (for example, about changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or we may want to let you know about and make informed choices in response to legal inquiries or complaints.</p><p>You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your account. You are responsible for keeping your account information up-to-date and for keeping your password secure.</p><p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken in connection with our Services. You shall not share or misuse your access credentials. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or of any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.</p><p>When you create a Collected Notes account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may contact you to share more details about what we have to offer. Don't worry -- if you aren't interested in learning more, you can opt out of the marketing communication, whether it's an email, phone call, or text message.</p><h4>3. Minimum Age Requirements</h4><p>Our Services are not directed to children. Access to and use of our Services is only for those over the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Union). If you are younger than this, you may not register for or use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older (or 16 years or older in the European Union).</p><h4>4. Responsibility of Visitors and Users</h4><p>We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the content (such as, but not limited to, text, photo, video, audio, code, computer software, items for sale, or other materials) posted to our Services by users or anyone else (“Content”) and are not responsible for any use or effects of such Content. So, for example:</p><p>We do not endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or non-harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights (see our Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy section to submit copyright complaints), or other proprietary rights of third parties. If you post Content, comment on a website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) Content available on our Services, you are entirely responsible for the Content, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from anyone’s use, purchase, or downloading of Content. If you access or use any Content, you are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Any Content offered for sale through any of our Services are the seller’s sole responsibility, and you agree that you will look solely to the seller for any damages that result from your purchase or use of Content. We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content. Please note that additional third party terms and conditions may apply to the downloading, copying, purchase, or use of Content. We also have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and web pages that link to, or are linked from, Collected Notes or our other Services. For example:</p><p>We do not have any control over those websites and are not responsible for their contents or their use. The existence of a link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse such website. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from non-Collected Notes websites.</p><h4>5.

Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h4><p>As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or associated with an Collected Notes product or service violates your copyright, please notify us in accordance with the Notice and Notice regime (Canada's DMCA) of the Canadian Copyright Act. We will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. We will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Collected Notes or others. In the case of such termination, we will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to us.</p><h4>8.

Your use of our Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Collected Notes or third party trademarks.</p><h4>9. Changes</h4><p>We are constantly updating our Services and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. These Terms may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Collected Notes, or by the posting by Collected Notes of a revised version. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period, or once the changes become effective. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.</p><h4>10. Termination</h4><p>We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or website’s URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any Collected Notes policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, (iii) ask you to make some adjustments, restrict the resources your website uses, or terminate your Services, if we believe your website’s storage or bandwidth usage is out of hand and/or burdens our systems (which is rare and typically only occurs when a website is used for file sharing or storage), or (iv) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.</p><p>If you wish to terminate the Agreement or your Collected Notes account, you may simply discontinue using our Services, or, if you are using a paid service, you may cancel at any time, subject to the Fees, Payment, and Renewal section in these Terms.</p><p>All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p><h4>11.

Arbitration Agreement</h4><p>Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under the Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in California, USA, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.</p><h4>14. Limitation of Liability</h4><p>In no event will Collected Notes, or its suppliers, partners, or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of the Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed $50 or the fees paid by you to Collected Notes under the Agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action, whichever is greater. Collected Notes shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p><h4>15. Indemnification</h4><p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Collected Notes, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of the Agreement or any agreement with a provider of third-party services used in connection with the Services, Content that you post, and any ecommerce activities conducted through your or another user’s website.</p><h4>16. US &amp; Canada Economic Sanctions</h4><p>You expressly represent and warrant that your use of our Services and/or associated services and products is not contrary to applicable U.S. and Canada Sanctions. Such use is prohibited, and we reserve the right to terminate accounts or access of those in the event of a breach of this condition.</p><h4>17. Translation</h4><p>These Terms were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control.</p><h4>18. Miscellaneous</h4><p>The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Collected Notes and you concerning the subject matter hereof. If any part of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under the Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; Collected Notes may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. The Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p></main><aside class="w-full p-4 mx-auto sm:p-8 max-w-prose xl:py-32 xl:pl-32 md:box-border md:sticky md:top-0 md:flex md:justify-between md:flex-col md:h-screen md:col-start-1 md:row-start-1 md:m-0 md:ml-auto md:py-16 md:pl-16 md:pr-0"><nav x-data="loadPage()"><h1 class="text-lg font-bold">Notes</h1><ul class="my-4"><template x-for="note in pageNotes" :key="note.id"><li><a class="hover:underline" :href="note.link" x-text="note.title"></a></li></template></ul><div><button class="mr-2" :class="{ 'font-semibold underline' : pageNumber > 0 }" :disabled="pageNumber <= 0" x-on:click="prevPage">Back</button> <button :class="{ 'font-semibold underline' : pageNumber < pageCount }" :disabled="pageNumber >= pageCount" x-on:click="nextPage">More</button></div></nav><footer class="mt-4"><ul><li><a class="hover:underline" href="https://github.com/distantcam/co11ection/">github</a></li><li><a class="hover:underline" href="https://collectednotes.com/">colllected notes</a></li><li><a class="hover:underline" href="https://www.11ty.dev/">eleventy</a></li></ul></footer></aside><script>var notes = [
